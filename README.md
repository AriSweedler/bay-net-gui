# Bayesian Network Engine Gui

You're here because you wanna make a [Bayesian Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_network), and you wanna visualize it. And maybe see what changing one parameter would do to another.

TODOs:
* Make a Bayesian Net class that represents a BN
* Write something that can display a BN
  * You can edit it by clicking on stuff
* Understand what data goes into a BN (is 1 CSV good enough to describe one?)
* Write a good way to get people's data into and outta the system
